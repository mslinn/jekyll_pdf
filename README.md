`jekyll_plugin_pdf`
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll_plugin_pdf.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll_plugin_pdf)
===========

`jekyll_plugin_pdf` is a Jekyll plugin that provides a new Liquid tag called `new_tag_name` and a new tag block called `new_tag_block_name`.
The plugin is packaged as a Ruby gem.

 * A `new_tag_block_name` block tag that can do magic with its eyes closed.
   ```
   {% new_tag_name [arguments] %}
   Contents of new_tag_block_name
   {% endnew_tag_name %}
   ```
 * A `new_tag_name` tag that can turn on a dime and leave 15 cents change.
   ```
   {% new_tag_name Contents of new_tag_name tag%}
   ```


## Demo
The `demo` directory contains a small Jekyll website pre-configured for instant gratification.
Run the demo by typing:
```shell
$ bin/attach demo
```

The `bin/attach` script builds the plugin locally and installs it locally,
then launches the demo Jekyll website under control of the Ruby Fast Debugger.

As described in [Debugging Jekyll Plugins with an IDE](https://www.mslinn.com/blog/2022/02/21/jekyll-debugging.html),
attach to the process using `ruby-debug-ide` by selecting the **Run / Debug** configuration called **Attach rdebug-ide**.

### Control Log Verbosity
`demo/_config.yml` contains a block of YAML that looks something like:
```yaml
plugin_loggers:
  PluginMetaLogger: info
  CleanHook: info
  DocumentHooks: info
  MyBlock: info
  PageHooks: info
  PostHooks: info
  SiteHooks: warn
```
The above sets the verbosity for each of the loggers.
Possible values are: `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`.


## Debugging
Run `bin/attach` and pass it the directory name of a Jekyll website that has a suitable script called `_bin/debug`.
The `demo` subdirectory fits this description.
```script
$ bin/attach demo
Successfully uninstalled jekyll_plugin_pdf-0.1.2
jekyll_plugin_pdf 0.1.2 built to pkg/jekyll_plugin_pdf-0.1.2.gem.
jekyll_plugin_pdf (0.1.2) installed.
Fast Debugger (ruby-debug-ide 0.7.3, debase 0.2.4.1, file filtering is supported) listens on 0.0.0.0:1234
```
Now attach to the debugger process.
This git repo includes a Visual Studio Code launcher for this purpose labeled `Attach rdebug-ide`.


## Additional Information
More information is available on Mike Slinn's web site about
[Jekyll plugins](https://www.mslinn.com/blog/index.html#Jekyll).


## Installation
This has already been done for the demo; these instructions are for incorporating the plugin(s) into other Jekyll websites.
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll_plugin_pdf'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll_plugin_pdf


## Usage

Given this markup in an HTML file:

```
{% block_tag_template param1="Today is a wonderful day!" %}
Hello, world!
{% endblock_tag_template %}
The rendered HTML from the block tag looks like this:
```

<p style="color: green; background-color: yellow; padding: 1em; border: solid thin grey;">Hello, world! Today is a wonderful day!</p>

Console output looks like this, when the plugin's log level is set to `debug`:
```
DEBUG MyBlock: tag_name = 'block_tag_template'
argument_string = 'param1="Today is a wonderful day!" '
@param1 = 'Today is a wonderful day!'
@param_x = ''
params =
  param1 = Today is a wonderful day!
  param2 =
  param3 =

DEBUG MyBlock: mode=""
page.path="_posts/2022-03-28-jekyll-plugin-template-collection.html"
page.url="/blog/2022/03/28/jekyll-plugin-template-collection.html"
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.


### Build and Install Locally
To build and install this gem onto your local machine, run:
```shell
$ rake install:local
```

The following also does the same thing:
```shell
$ bundle exec rake install
jekyll_plugin_pdf 0.1.0 built to pkg/jekyll_plugin_pdf-0.1.0.gem.
jekyll_plugin_pdf (0.1.0) installed.
```

Examine the newly built gem:
```shell
$ gem info jekyll_plugin_pdf

*** LOCAL GEMS ***

    Write a short summary; RubyGems requires one.
```


### Build and Push to RubyGems
To release a new version,
  1. Update the version number in `version.rb`.
  2. Commit all changes to git; if you don't the next step might fail with an unexplainable error message.
  3. Run the following:
     ```shell
     $ bundle exec rake release
     ```
     The above creates a git tag for the version, commits the created tag,
     and pushes the new `.gem` file to [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org).
